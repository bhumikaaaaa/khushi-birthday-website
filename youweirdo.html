        My dear Khushi, it is I your Magic Mirror.<br>
        You were in my visions again the other night.<br>
        You see, as your Magic Mirror, I frequently<br>
        see what you're up to.<br>
        You are my Eternal Muse!<br>
        <br><br>
        And I've seen so much beauty ~<br>
        So much abundance ~<br>
        So much potential in you.<br>
        <br><br>

        Even during these difficult times ~ <br>
        Youâ€™ve kept your grace ~ <br>
        This is how I know, beyond all doubt ~<br>
        That the best has yet to come for you.<br>
        Not by far Khushi!<br>
        <br><br>
        Now, I usually keep my Mirrorly visions to myself.<br>
        (Destiny and the space-time continuum are fragile things, you see.)<br>
        But since we're in this quiet space, I'm going to bend this cosmic law<br>
        and show you a slice of your destiny in the very near future.<br>
        <br><br>
        Are you ready for it?<br>
        <br>
        Take a deep breath, and listen carefully:<br>
        You are about to become someone who has it all.<br>
        Someone who savors the best life has to offer.<br>
        Someone who no longer lives by the illusion of lack or insufficiency.<br>
        Someone with the time, freedom, and resources to gleefully sculpt reality to your advantage.<br>
        It's a wonderful turning point for you Khushi.<br>
        <br><br>
        And it all begins right now when you make the simple choice to look within ~<br>
